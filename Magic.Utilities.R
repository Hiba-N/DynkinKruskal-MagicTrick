# # # 1) Create a file named Magic.Utilities.R containing the following functions.

# # # 1a) Write a function which will take as an argument, at a minimum, 
# # the starting card of the trick. The function will play the game, and then return either 
# # the index or a string describing the last card that was found.

# globa

# card.magic <- function(init_card_index, deck) {
     
#      current_card_value <- deck[]
#      current_card_position <- deck[]

     

#     return final_card
# }


magic.deck <- c(rep(c(4, 4, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), each = 4))
#print(magic.deck) #sanity check

# # 1b) Write a function that will

# # set up the magic trick,
# # randomly pick 2 cards from within the first 10 cards, one for the volunteer and one for the magician,
# # run through the trick twice, once for the volunteer, and once for the magician.
# # The function should return a boolean value, indicating whether or not the magician correctly 'guessed' the
#  volunteer's final card. The sample and rep commands may be useful.
