# # 1) Create a file named Magic.Utilities.R containing the following functions.

# # 1a) Write a function which will take as an argument, at a minimum, 
# the starting card of the trick. The function will play the game, and then return either 
# the index or a string describing the last card that was found.

# # 1b) Write a function that will

# # set up the magic trick,
# # randomly pick 2 cards from within the first 10 cards, one for the volunteer and one for the magician,
# # run through the trick twice, once for the volunteer, and once for the magician.
# # The function should return a boolean value, indicating whether or not the magician correctly 'guessed' the
#  volunteer's final card. The sample and rep commands may be useful.
